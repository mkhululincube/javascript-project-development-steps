> Tutorial will be based on javascript projects however the knowledge can be applied on any type of software project :


To demostrate we will use the tools below:

## Steps

## PLANNING

This is the stage in which UML Diagrams are crafted.

> Determine the size of project

> Timeline for the project

> Number of people that will be working on the software project

The number of people working on the project, timeline and size of project will help you 
chose the suitable Software Development Methodology.

> Upon chosing the methodology determine the tools to be used.

## Project Management Tools 

> Jira/Trello/Asana etc

For bigger and complex projects Jira is the most suitable

> Kanban boards - visually depict work at various stages of a process using cards 
to represent work items and columns to represent each stage of the process.

### Assign tasks

## DESIGN

Project Wireframes / Mockups

There are quite a number of wireframing tools that you can use. 

However I have used Justinmind.

Submit wireframes for approval. Once they are approved its time to move to the next stage which is development.


#DEVELOPMENT

Personel involved : Developers, Architects, Database Administrators and DevOps

### Tools

Tools are determined by the size of the project.

####Version Control

Using version control software helps you keep track of changes â€” and keep every team member working off the latest version

For version control you can use git, svn, mercurial or subversion depending on your preference and project spec however Git is widely used.



#### Docker 

> To mantain same environment between your team members

> Version control system for your entire app's operating system
